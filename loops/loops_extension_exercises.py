# Below is a list of foods and their prices per unit:

# Ask the user how many units of each item they bought, then output the corresponding receipt.
# For the input below, assume that the input is provided in the same order as defined in the list above.
# # ========Izzy's Food Emporium========
# # Input: 1        Output: Baby Spinach    $2.78
